I"›<p>Lattice-based cryptography has a variety of <em>slightly</em> different encryption
schemes.
In this post Iâ€™ll discuss two common ones (the initial <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/qcrypto.pdf">â€œscalingâ€ scheme due to Regev</a>, and a
scheme which uses the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/501">Micciancio-Piekert â€œgadgetâ€ matrix</a>), and show how they
can be formally connected via the Discrete Fourier transform.
Moreover, Iâ€™ll discuss how a key property of the â€œgadgetâ€ matrix (that it has
unusually â€œshortâ€ preimages),
can be interpreted as a consequence of (a generalized form of) the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.</p>
