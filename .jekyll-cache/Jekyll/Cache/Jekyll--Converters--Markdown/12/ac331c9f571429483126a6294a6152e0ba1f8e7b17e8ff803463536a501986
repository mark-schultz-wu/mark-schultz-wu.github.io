I"¸<p>I have recently seen a talk on the paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1234">Efficient Homomorphic Comparison
Methods with Optimal
Complexity</a>, which I have found quite
interesting.
I tried generalizing their result for a bit and hit a snag.
Since then I have some slightly new ideas, so I decided to flesh them out here.
At a minimum I think that this gives an interesting presentation of their
result.</p>

<p>As the title makes clear, the paper is about computing <em>comparison queries</em>
using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).
Comparison queries are of the form:</p>
