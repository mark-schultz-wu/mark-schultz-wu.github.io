Hi, I'm a recent graduate (PhD) from UCSD.
Most of my work is in lattice cryptography, but I've made this blog as a place
to store some random thoughts that I have on various topics within theoretical
computer science.




# Papers

Rather than keep an updated list here, I'll link to my [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5761-9662) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkiE2lMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profiles.
Note that I have published under the name "Mark Schultz" in the past, but am publishing under the name "Mark Schultz-Wu" going forward.
